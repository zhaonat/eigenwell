# eigenwell
finite difference based eigensolving. Eigensolving is more nuanced than it initially might seem. What eigenvalue are you solving for, frequency or k? How do you formulate the problem for each?

### Conventions
The code in eigenwell implements everything using

## omega eigenproblem

## omega to k eigenproblem

## k to omega eigenproblem
